When Alex first started learning to code, they felt Overwhelmed!!! Python, JavaScript, HTML -- it all seemed like a DIFFERENT language. 
But over time, they discovered that each BUG was an opportunity to grow. ðŸ’»ðŸ’¡

"why won't this LOOP run???" they'd ask...   "oh! i forgot to indent."

After weeks of debugging, testing, & building small projects, Alex finally created their first web application ---> a simple to-do list app that helped them track their progress.

It wasnâ€™t perfect, but it was THEIRS. And it worked  .

Alex then moved on to building bigger things...  A calculator! A blog!   And eventually, they became a full-stack developer.
